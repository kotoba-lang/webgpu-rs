;;
;; `:render/props` `:trees` is a two-part template (trunk + canopy) whose
;; resolution semantics live in Clojure inside `kotoba.webgpu-rs.scene/scatter`.
;; If the general expander is worth having, it must reproduce that shipped
;; output *exactly* for real coordinates — otherwise it is a second, subtly
;; different renderer of the same authoring intent.
;;
;; These are the real `:trees` values from
;; kami-engine/kami-clj-play3d/games/royale/scene.edn, with `:ratio` forced to
;; 1.0 so every accepted scatter slot becomes a tree pair (the scatter's RNG
;; and its centre-rejection stay scene.cljc's business; we only consume where
;; it put things).
